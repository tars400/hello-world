# hello-world

Hi,
I am vehement and fanatic about Mobile Computing and technology, Coding, Start Ups, Machine Learning, System on Chips, Internet of Things, Open Source technology, Entrepreneurship, Computer Networks, Investments, Stocks and Table Tennis.

Worked on several well known programming languages, Android and Web development projects, also dabbled in a few Micro-Controllers and corresponding tools. Applied these technical skills to solve real world problems.

As a self motivated individual driven by a strong interest, my objective is to contribute, support and to be a part of Start Up culture or an Open Source community, Non profit organizations and Poverty alleviation programs.

Keen interest in Startups, Hackathons, Coding challenges and Gaming.,
